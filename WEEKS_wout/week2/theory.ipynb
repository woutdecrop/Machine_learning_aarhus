    "## Ex 7: Implementing Regression Stumps WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK\n",
    "In this exercise your task is to implement Regression Trees that consist of one internal node (the root) and two leafs.\n",
    "Such trees are known as Regression Stumps.\n",
    "For the loss/cost function we consider least squares loss $(h(x) - y)^2$ \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the learning algorithm has to find the best possible feature to split the training data using a single feature value pair in regards to Least Squares loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have decided for you to present a Regression Stump by \n",
    "- idx: the data/feature vector index to consider in the root node (the one question asked)\n",
    "- val: the value to compare to for data feature idx in the root node\n",
    "- left: the value to return for a data point if it ends up in left leaf (x[idx] < val) (only question type we consider in a node)\n",
    "- right: the value to return for a data point if it ends up in the right leaf (x[idx] >= val)\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach we follow is as follows. Assume the input data has n data points each a vector of $d$ real numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each data feature f:\n",
    "-   Compute for all possible values $v$ for feature $f$ in the training data, the least squares cost of the stump achieved by using feature f and value $v$ in the root using the optimal value in the two leafs. This gives a list of of costs, one for each split ($f, v: \\textrm{cost}$). \n",
    "- Pick the split $f, v$ with minimal cost and create the corresponding tree by setting idx, val, left, right\n",
    " \n",
    "Your task is to give a full implementation of this algorithm and specify the running time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**hint:** It is fine to implement a simple version for finding the best split that takes $O(d n^2)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "See **regression_stumps.py** for starter code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You need to complete the RegressionStump class by completing the following methods**\n",

    "- implement score\n",
    "- implement fit\n",
    "\n",
    "We advice to implement in the order specified.\n",
