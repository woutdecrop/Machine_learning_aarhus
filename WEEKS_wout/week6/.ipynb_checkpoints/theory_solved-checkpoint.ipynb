    "## Exercise 1: Neural Network Design\n",
    "In this exercise your task is to neural networks by hand that compute simple functions.\n",
    "For the nonlinear transform you can mix them any way you like but you can only use, identity, sign, relu and sigmoid transforms in the neurons.\n",
    "You can make the networks as wide and deep as you would like but small networks are sufficient.\n",
    "* Make a network that computes $c \\cdot x$ for any constant c\n",
    "* Make a network that computes xor of inputs $x_1$ and $x_2$. \n",
    "* Make a network that computes max($x_1$,$x_2$)\n",
    "* Make a network that computes $x^2$ - for x in range {2,3,4,5} i.e. x is an integer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hint 1: It is usually easier to find an easy mathematical expression that solves the problem and then to make a network that implements that**\n",
    "- **Hint 2: The only nonlinear transfrom the teacher uses is relu (and identity)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SOLUTION MATH HERE\n",
    "A single neuron. Weights c. Nonlinear-transform is identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In first layer: One neuron with weights (1,1) and bias -1, taking ReLU. Another neuron with weights (-1,-1) bias +1, taking ReLU. Output layer one neuron with weight (-1,-1) and bias 1, identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In first layer: One neuron with weights (1,-1), taking ReLU. Another neuron with weights (-1,1) taking ReLU. And a neuron computing the sum of the two inputs using weights (1,1), identity. Output layer has weights (1/2,1/2,1/2) and identity. Observe: Sum of first two neurons in first layer is max(x_1,x_2)-min(x_1,x_2). Adding x_1+x_2 cancels out the smallest and leaves twice the max. Dividing it all by 2 gives the desired result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simpler result by Rasmus and William: two neurons. The first has weights (=1,-1), taking ReLU. The second one has weights (1,0,1), where (1) is from output of the first neuron, and the other (1) is from the variable with weight -1 in the first neuron. Observe that if x_1>x_2, we have x_1 = x_1-x_2 + x_2 = out(first neuron) + input(second neuron). Otherwise x_2 is the answer, with the output of the first neuron being 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a small network testing whether x = y. This is done by having two neurons, one having weight -1 and bias +y and another having weight 1 and bias -y. Both have ReLU. If x=y then both are 0. Otherwise, one is 0 and one is >= 1. Now create a new neuron taking the two previous as inputs with weight -1000 on both and bias y^2, taking ReLU. This becomes y^2 iff x=y, and otherwise it becomes 0. Do this for every y in 2,3,4,5 and create a neuron with weight 1,1,1,1 summing these and using identity.\n",
